# Sudoku Solver v1.0


SudokuSolver Class (uses Sudoku class) Originally created for COSC2007A Assignment 1 Problem #1, by me - January 31, 2018.
Updated to accept filename as argument for GitHub by me on June 5, 2019.

Java source files are excluded as it is a common second year student assignment. 

Command Line Argument: ``Java SudokuSolver [Filename.extension]`` 

May need to include path if puzzle file is in a different folder.

It solves the puzzle, displays it and saves the solved puzzle in 2 formats: one in normal format and another well formatted for displaying purposes.

Sample files are included for reference.
